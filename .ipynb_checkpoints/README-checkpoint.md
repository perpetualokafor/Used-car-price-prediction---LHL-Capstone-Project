## Project Aim
The goal of this project is to predict the price of a used car. This can be helpful to both the seller and the buyer. There are individulas who at some point in thier lives have decided to sell or buy a used car. This will be a good tool for individuals like that to use in order to avoid under selling or paying too much for a car.
