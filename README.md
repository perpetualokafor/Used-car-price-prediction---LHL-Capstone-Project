## Project Aim
The goal of this project is to predict the price of a used car. This can be helpful to both the seller and the buyer. There are individulas who at some point in thier lives have decided to sell or buy a used car. This will be a good tool for individuals like that to use in order to avoid under selling or paying too much for a car. 

## Data
The data was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data). The data contains features like car model and manufacturer, mileage, fuel type, year the car was manufactured e.t.c. These features were used to make the prediction.

## Result
RadomForest regressor model was used to train the data. It had an R2 score of 0.77. 

## Model Deployment
The model was tested by running the application.py file on the terminal and opening the web address that was generated.
